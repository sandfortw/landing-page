# landing-page
Landing page project for Odin Project (CSS Practice)


This was my first real forray into using flex-box. Coming out of a back-end development program,
I had somehow avoided really messing with it until now. There are some issues for sure--I was not,
for example, able to get the picture on the header to line up with the links whilst preserving shrinking, but I am reasonably satisfied with this attempt, at least for learning purposes.
